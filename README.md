# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes intermittently without providing any error messages in the terminal.  The cause of the crash is not immediately apparent, and the issue makes debugging and development significantly challenging.

## Bug Description

The Expo development server crashes randomly. There are no error messages or logs in the terminal to indicate the cause of the crash. The project functions correctly before the crash and resumes functioning after restarting the server. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo start`. 
4. Observe the server over time. The server will eventually crash without any clear reason.

## Potential Solutions

The solution involves careful monitoring and potential adjustments to environment variables, package versions or using more verbose logging mechanisms to try to identify the cause.  In cases where there is no immediate solution, restarting the server may be the only workaround.  This repository's solution branch demonstrates these potential methods.
