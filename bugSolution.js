I haven't been able to pinpoint the exact cause of the random crashes, but I have implemented some strategies to improve stability and potentially identify the source in the future:

1. **Enhanced Logging:**  I've added more detailed console logs to track the app's lifecycle and any potential errors that might be masked. This makes identifying a source more probable.
2. **Environment Checks:** The code includes checks for common development environment inconsistencies, such as network issues or low memory.  This added debugging will show if there's a correlation between the crashes and the environment state.
3. **Asynchronous Operations Monitoring:** If there's a crash related to asynchronous operations, checking the state of promises and async/await calls can help pinpoint any failures that could contribute to the issue.

These improvements increase the chances of identifying and addressing this intermittent issue, moving past simple restarting of the server and towards understanding the root cause.  These changes are on the 'solution' branch.
